Met with Dr. Pollacia 3-20-17

Proposed next meeting - April 19th at 1:30pm (Need to reserve library room)
   - Proposed the idea of meeting separately from Dr. Hammonds - Odie (so we could focus just on ITEC in our meeting)
     - She didn't mind not meeting with her


MAY UPDATE:

Requirements Updates and to-do list:
   - Rename 'ITEC Major GPA' to 'Concentration GPA'
     - For that field add a help field (maybe a question mark the user can click) that tells the user where
       to go to find that GPA. (Go to banner -> See degree works -> etc etc...)

   - She likes the exports option, but... 
     - She wants to be able to export the applications for a specified semester and year (e.g - Spring 2018 applicants)
     - She wants to be able to export the ITEC sites (see below)

   - She wants to be able to export the contacts for a specific site
     - Perhaps we have an export button at the bottom of the each site?

   - She dislikes the idea of having duplicate applications for a student
     - She wants a student to be able to edit a previously submitted application
        - Then each student could only have 1 application for ITEC and BIO
        - This would reduce the chaos that would happen upon exporting a list of applications 
        (think of having 10 applications for the same student for a specific semester/year)
            - This will require some substantial work
                - After a student creates an application for ITEC -> Display an 'EDIT app' button rather
                than a 'CREATE app' button on the home screen. 
                - Upon clicking the app the student would be shown the ITEC app page with the fields populated
                with their last submission.
 
   - We need to assign the list of sites as ITEC or BIO.
        - We need to add an option upon site creation that says "ITEC or BIO" (drop down probably)
        - She emails me a list of itec sites that we can use to update the existing sites
            - This'll be a pain, but it's necessary for export clarity
