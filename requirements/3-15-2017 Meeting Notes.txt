Met with Dr. Hammonds - Odie 3-15-2017

Updated biology (some overlap with itec too) requirements:
    - Update "Major and Concentration" field within biology application to "Concentration"
        - Add concentrations to a dropdown within that field
    - If they say 'No' to "Are you applying to an Internship Site previously approved by Internship committee?"
        - Display the fields from 'Name of Site' to Education Component
    - Renamed "Internship Site" to "Approved Internship Committee Sites" for clarity
        - Allow for the approved internship committee sites to be updated
    - The following paragraph within the bioapp is confusing:    
        - "If you plan on applying for more than one �Build Your Own� site, feel 
           free to copy and paste the Proposed Site Information Section above of 
           this application and complete. For each site, you would need a proposed 
           mentor to complete the Preceptor Application (also on myGGC SST Internship Pages)."   
    - Instructor view
        - Are allowed to add notes to the document uploads and applications
        - ONLY ADMINS are allowed to leave feedback 
    - Proposed internship date should be included within the biology applicants exports
        - She wants the ability to choose the which internship date applicants to export
    - She wants the "GGC Internship App" to be renamed to GGCSST 
        - But I think she thought that because of the logo
            - Maybe we should remove the logo? and the background picture? lol\
